# Mapty
Summary:- Summary for README file:

This project is a web application that allows users to log their workouts, specifically running and cycling activities, on a map. Users can input data such as the type of workout, distance, duration, and other relevant details through a form. The application then displays the logged workouts as markers on the map. The workouts can be clicked on to view more details. Users can also toggle between running and cycling activities and input different data accordingly. The application uses Geolocation to get the user's position and displays the map accordingly. Workouts are saved to local storage, so they persist even after reloading the page. The project is built using JavaScript and Leaflet.js library for handling maps. The code follows the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, with classes for Workout, Running, Cycling, and App. The Workout class serves as the base class, and Running and Cycling classes inherit from it. The App class handles the main application logic, including event listeners and rendering the workouts on the map and in the list.

Brief Explanation:- 

1. **Interactive Map Interface**: The project provides an interactive map interface where users can log their running and cycling workouts. The map is powered by Leaflet.js, a popular open-source mapping library.

2. **Geolocation**: The application utilizes the Geolocation API to automatically detect the user's position and center the map on their location. This feature enhances user experience by providing a personalized view of the map.

3. **Easy Workout Logging**: Users can easily log their workouts by filling out a simple form. The form dynamically adjusts based on the selected workout type, allowing for a seamless experience.

4. **Workout Visualization**: Logged workouts are displayed as markers on the map, making it easy for users to visualize their exercise routes and locations.

5. **Detailed Workout Information**: Each workout marker on the map provides essential details such as the workout type, distance, and duration. Additional information like pace, cadence (for running), and elevation gain (for cycling) is also displayed for respective workouts.

6. **Responsive Design**: The application is built with a responsive design, ensuring that it works well on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

7. **Local Storage**: All logged workouts are stored in the browser's local storage, enabling data persistence even after the page is closed or refreshed. Users can view their previous workouts whenever they access the application.

8. **Easy Setup**: The project uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No additional libraries or frameworks are required, making it easy to set up and run on any modern web browser.

9. **Code Modularity**: The codebase is structured using classes and follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This approach promotes code modularity and maintainability.

10. **Fast and Efficient**: The application leverages JavaScript's built-in functionalities for array manipulation and iteration, ensuring efficient performance even for large datasets.

11. **User-Friendly**: The application provides meaningful error messages and input validations, ensuring that users provide accurate and valid data for their workouts.

12. **Reset Option**: A reset button is included that allows users to clear all saved workouts from local storage and start fresh.
